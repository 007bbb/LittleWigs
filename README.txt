LittleWigs


Description-

To put it simply, these are BigWigs modules that add some warnings to the bosses found in 5-man instances.

Many of the modules included need testing, I can't write a module until I've captured some logs in most cases, so I need several runs of an instance to gather and then test.  While nothing should prohibit you game place, not all modules might work as precicely as you/I'd like them to.


Usage-
Drop this folder into the Addons folder like any other addon.  It automatically integrates with BigWigs.

Should you not desire to even see some of the modules in the menu because you feel you don't want them, just delete the corresponding bosses .lua file or the entire instance folder.


Load-On-Demand-
If you want to make each instance load on demand just run the LOD script to move the individual modules to the root.

Contributions-

If you would like to contribute you can do it in a few ways.
1) Download and install Transcriptor(from wowace.com), activate it when you start your instance run and turn it off when you're done. It will log all the necessary messages for creating new warnings. Note: Not EVERYTHING can be warned, for example the mushrooms during Hungarfen in Underbog.
2) Write & Test the module yourself then send to me to include
3) Simply write me an e-mail and request it.  I'm in a small guild and don't get in ALOT of instance runs, and we don't progress at break-neck speed, but I'll add it to the to-do list and get to as soon as I can.
4) Report any problems or inaccuracies you have with a module
